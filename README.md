Tips

Restarting the server

When you make changes to any JavaScript files, you have to restart the server. Just press ctrl + c in the terminal to stop the server and npm start or node ./bin/www to start it up again. This process can get very tedious, so I highly recommend that you install Nodemon. This package will automatically restart your server every time you make changes to your JS files. All you have to do is run sudo npm install -g nodemon to install the package globally and then run nodemon ./bin/www. The package takes care of the rest!
